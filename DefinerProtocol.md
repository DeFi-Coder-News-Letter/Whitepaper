# DeFiner Protocol
## Specificiation
https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/definer/blockchain/1.0.0

## Authentication
### API Key Authentication
We evaluated OAuth2 and choose to not using it for two major reasons:
* the following approach is simplier to implement for client application
* username/password concept is not coupled in this API model for wider adaptions.

The following is what the DeFiner Blockchain API uses to grant a tenant access to the API.

Before being able to sign any requests as a tenant, a tenant must register an public key through DeFiner by contracting DeFiner account management personnel. This process is designed to be seperated from the API direct access, so that we exchange sensitive keys information in a secure channel.

Upon creating an account, tenant must generate a public/private key pair and provide the public key to DeFiner account management personnel.
DeFiner will only store the public key for a tenant.

A tenant must remember the following information to make future API request.
* tenantId
* tenantPrivateKey

All future requests should be encrypted using the tenantPrivateKey and provide the tenantId for DeFiner to locate associated public key for decryption.

The purpose for this mechenism ensures the following properties while tenants make API requests:
* It guarantees DeFiner receives a request made by a valid tenant
* It guarantees a request is made by the tenant who sent it.
* It guarantees the content of the request is created by the tenant who sent it and unforgeable during transportation.
* It raises the attack difficulty for the high computing cost for encrypting using private key.

Blockchain operation is expected to be a not high volume but secure transaction, this sophiscicate approach making requests securelly ensures the trust between tenants and DeFiner for all API access.
