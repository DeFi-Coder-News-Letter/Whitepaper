# DeFiner Protocol
## Specificiation
https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/definer/blockchain/1.0.0

## Authentication
### API Key Authentication
Before being able to sign any requests as a tenant, you must register an public key through DeFiner by contract DeFiner account management personel. This process is designed to be seperated from the API so we exchange sensitive keys information in a secure channel.

Upon creating an account, tenant must generate a public/private key pair and send the public key to DeFiner.
DeFiner will only store the public key for a tenant.

A tenant must remember the following information to make future API request.
* tenantId
* tenantPrivateKey

All future requests should be encrypted using the tenantPrivateKey.
